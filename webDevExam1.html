    <h1>The Brief History of Japan</h1><hr>

    <h2>i. Ancient Japan</h2>

    <p>
        Early Anicent Japan is divided into five different Major Eras<br>
        <dfn>The Paleolithic</dfn> (c. 50,000 BC – c. 12,000BC), <dfn>Jomon</dfn> (c.11,000 BC to 300 BC), <br>
        Yayoi (9,000 BC – 250 AD), Kofun (300 AD – 552 AD) and Yamato Periods (552-710 AD).<br>
        In this Paleolithic period the early ancestors of Japanese came from the mainland China/Korean Penninusla and traveled to Japan during the ice age
        then in the Jomon Period<br> the ice caps connecting the mainland China melted and thus completely isolated Japan. <br>
        <dfn>The Yayoi period</dfn> (400 BC to 300 AD) is a pivotal period in the history of Japan during which Japan starts cultivating rice and the first sedentary communities appear. <br>
        It was also the time of the famous kingdom of Yamatai, ruled by the legendary princess Himiko. <br>
        The Kofun period of Japan spanned from around 250 C.E. to 538 C.E. The period gets its name from large burial mounds called tumuli. <br>
        These burial mounds were keyhole-shaped and contained stone tombs where the noble and elite were buried. Inside the tomb, artifacts to honor the deceased lay with them. <br>
        <dfn>The Yamato Period</dfn>, commonly broken into two separate eras: <dfn>the Kofun</dfn> (“tumulus”) Era, from 250 to 538, and the Asuka Era, from 538 to 710, saw the emergence of a central governing power in the west of Japan, centered around the Yamato Province (highlighted in yellow on the map).  <br>
        It was in this location that a local clan (also known as Yamato) began to consolidate its power and establish its claim as the imperial bloodline of the nation.  The native religion, Shintō, was already in full flower, and its mythology was woven into Yamato claim of suzerainty.  <br>
        The areas in red indicate the boundaries of Yamato culture as well as political alliance and administration. <br>

    <h2>ii. Classical Japan</h2>

    <p>
        Classical Period (538 – 1185)
        The Classical Period opened with a big leap in the political, social, and artistic aspects of the Japanese society, 
        including the fruition of the Yamato rule and the beginnings of Buddhism in Japan. This formative stage is known as the Asuka period.

    <h2>iii. Feudal Japan</h2>

    <p>
        Feudal Japan lasted from the years 1185 AD to 1603 AD. During this period in Japan’s history, the shoguns held more power in society than the emperor and the imperial court. In the feudal society, the shoguns handed out land to their loyal followers and these estates were then overseen by different stewards and constables. <br>
        Japan was not the only country to operate under a feudal system, but theirs was different to the feudalism in Europe. <br>
        Whilst, to begin with, the jito (territory stewards) and shugo (military constables) did not have any land of their own, they began to gain power over time and, in doing so, became huge landowners. <br>
        The jito and shugo also began to have their own private armies and became capable of challenging the shogunate governments. This system of feudalism broke down as the jito and shugo gained more and more power. <br>

    <h2>iv. Early Modern Japan</h2>

    <p>
        Early modern Japan, or the period between 1600 and 1868, witnessed the birth of many of Japan's most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as the expansion of its basic geographic boundaries. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>v. Modern Japan</h2>

    <P>
        This period is divided into 5 different periods: <em>The Late Edo Period</em>, <em>Meiji Period (1868-1912)</em>, <em>Taisho Period (1912-1926)</em>, <em>Showa Period (1926-1989)</em> and <em>Heisei and Reiwa Periods (1989-2019, 2019-Current)</em>.
